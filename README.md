 smart phoneâ€™s fingerprint sensor to control a door lock
 
Fingerprint Door Lock system using Arduino and Smart phone.

In this project, we are going to build a Biometric Lock using Arduino Nano with Bluetooth Module, Solenoid Lock, and Android Phone. Apart from hardware, a mobile application is also used to scan and verify the fingerprint and send the confirmation ID to Arduino through Bluetooth. Here we will use Smart Phone Finger Print Sensor to lock and unlock the door lock.

Components Required
1.Arduino Nano
2.Bluetooth Module (HC05)
3.Relay Module
4.Solenoid Lock
5.Buzzer
6.LED
7.Jumper Wires
Solenoid Lock
1.Solenoid lock has a low-voltage solenoid that pulls the latch back into the door when an interrupt (Pushbutton, Relay, etc.) is activated.
2.The operating voltage for the solenoid lock is 12V. You can also use 9V, but it results in slower operation.\
3.Solenoid door locks are mainly used in remote areas to automate operations without involving any human effort.
